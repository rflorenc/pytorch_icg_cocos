## Image Caption Generation (ICG) using PyTorch

This project uses a subset of the [COCO "Common Objects in Context" dataset](https://cocodataset.org/) [<a href="#ref1">1</a>] for image caption generation, consisting of 5029 of these images, each of which has five or more different descriptions of the salient entities and activities.  
The jupyter notebook `ICG_COCO.ipynp` contains reference code and explanations.  Actual images and annotation subsets need to be downloaded from the COCO official web-page and placed in the corresponding directories.
